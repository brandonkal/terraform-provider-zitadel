## About this Terraform Provider

This is the official ZITADEL Terraform provider.
It lets you declare ZITADEL resources declaratively and apply the resources to any ZITADEL instance.
Importing existing resources to the Terraform state is supported.
Therefore, as long as you have all resources declared, it is even easy to migrate state between instances.

The provider is currently in [Beta state](https://zitadel.com/docs/support/general) and the support level is Enterprise Support.
